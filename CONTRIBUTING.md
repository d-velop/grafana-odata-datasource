# How to report a bug

## Security vulnerability

Please do **NOT** open an issue if you find a security vulnerability.
Instead, send an e-mail to ``securityissue@d-velop.de`` .

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue.
Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue,
so if you're unsure, just email us.
